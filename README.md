# Pets Please Pablo
A robot dog who asks for attention when you're nearby. He wags his tail while you're petting him and gives up if it's been too long since he sensed motion before being pet.

An Arduino Uno, 2 servos (to drive his neck and tail), a small PIR motion sensor for a nose, and a photocell on top of his head.
